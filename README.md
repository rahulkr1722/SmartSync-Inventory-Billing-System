Best-selling products

Monthly sales reports

Stock alerts for low inventory

**5. üåê Web Portal Development**
Develop a web-based admin dashboard for managing products, staff, sales reports, and customers online.

**6. üì¶ Bulk Product Upload**
Allow uploading product lists via **CSV/Excel** files, making inventory setup quicker for large stores.

**7. üì± Push Notifications (Android)**
Notify staff about **new product additions**, **low stock alerts**, or **important announcements** via in-app notifications.

**8. üé® Custom Theme Manager**
Let users choose or create **custom UI** themes apart from Light and Dark mode to personalize their experience.

**9. üè¨ Customer Management System**
Maintain a **customer database**, loyalty points, and generate invoices linked to customer profiles for better service.

**10. üõ†Ô∏è Auto Software Updates**
Add an automatic updater that checks for new software versions and patches to ensure users are always on the latest release.


### **Project Objectives**
- Simplify and automate inventory and billing processes.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for efficient business operations.
- Enable businesses to generate and manage data reports seamlessly.
- Optimize customer experience with features like barcode scanning and data export.


## Setup and Run Instructions

This section guides you on how to set up and run the Smart Inventory and Billing System on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** (Specify the version used, e.g., JDK 11 or later) - You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenAdoptium](https://adoptium.net/).
* **MySQL Server:** (Specify the version used) - Download and install from [MySQL Community Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/community/).
* **MySQL Workbench (Optional):** A GUI tool for managing MySQL databases, helpful for setting up the database.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd SmartInventoryBillingSystem
    ```
    (Replace the link with your actual repository URL).

2.  **Database Setup:**
    * Ensure your MySQL server is running.
    * You can use MySQL Workbench or the command line to create the database and tables.
    * **Using the provided SQL script:**
        * Navigate to the `Database` directory:
            ```bash
            cd Database
            ```
        * Execute the `schema.sql` script to create the necessary tables. You might need to adjust the script based on your MySQL setup. For example, using the MySQL command line client:
            ```bash
            mysql -u <your_mysql_username> -p <database_name> < schema.sql
            ```
            (Replace `<your_mysql_username>` and `<database_name>` accordingly. You might need to create the database first using `CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;`).
        * (Optional) You can execute `sample_data.sql` to insert some initial data.

3.  **Import Libraries:**
    * The necessary JAR files (e.g., `mysql-connector-java-*.jar`, `itextpdf-*.jar` or `jasperreports-*.jar`) are located in the `SourceCode/lib` directory.
    * If you are using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you need to add these JAR files to your project's dependencies or classpath.

4.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    * Locate the Java source files that handle the database connection (likely in the `com.example.inventory.database` package).
    * Update the database connection details (URL, username, password) within the Java code to match your MySQL server configuration.

### Running the Application

1.  **Using an IDE (Recommended):**
    * Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans).
    * Ensure that the JAR files in the `SourceCode/lib` directory are added to the project's build path or dependencies.
    * Locate the main entry point of the application (usually a class with a `main` method, like `Main.java` in the `src/com/example/inventory` package).
    * Run the `Main.java` file to start the application.

2.  **Running from the Command Line:**
    * Navigate to the root directory of the project.
    * Compile the Java source files:
        ```bash
        javac -cp "SourceCode/lib/*:SourceCode/src" SourceCode/src/com/example/inventory/*.java SourceCode/src/com/example/inventory/models/*.java SourceCode/src/com/example/inventory/views/*.java SourceCode/src/com/example/inventory/controllers/*.java SourceCode/src/com/example/inventory/database/*.java SourceCode/src/com/example/inventory/utils/*.java
        ```
        (Adjust the command based on your package structure).
    * Run the application:
        ```bash
        java -cp "SourceCode/lib/*:SourceCode/src" com.example.inventory.Main
        ```
        (Replace `com.example.inventory.Main` with the actual path to your main class).

## Usage Examples/Demo

1.  **Login:** Upon starting the application, you will be presented with a login screen. Enter valid credentials to access the system.
2.  **Dashboard:** After successful login, the dashboard will display a summary of key information (if implemented).
3.  **Product Management:** Navigate to the "Products" section to add new products, view existing stock, edit product details, or delete products.
4.  **Billing:** Go to the "Billing" section to create new bills. Select products, enter quantities, and the system will calculate the total. You can then generate and save the bill as a PDF.

**Refer to the `Documentation/CompleteProjectReport.pdf` for detailed usage instructions and screenshots of the application's interface.**
